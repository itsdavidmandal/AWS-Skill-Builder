Bias : 
Biases are the assumptions that the model makes about the data. 

High bias means that the model is too simple and cannot capture the patterns in the date as expected. 

Variance : 
It is the model's sensitivity to small changes in the training data. 

High variance means that the model is too complex. The model will perform well on the training data but badly on the new unseen data .
